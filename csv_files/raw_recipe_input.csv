Grandma Donna’s Chocolate Sauce,2,"1/4 pound butter (one stick), 3 squares (3 oz) chocolate (this would be 12 now, as Bakers’ Chocolate comes in ¼ oz “squares”...used to be 1 oz squares. Just be mindful of whatever the brand is packaged as...that is, by weight.), 3 cups sugar, Dash salt, 1 tall can evaporated milk (Carnation Milk)
Melt butter and chocolate over hot water. (I use a double boiler.) Stir in sugar one tablespoon at a time. (This is tedious, but important to get smooth results.) Add milk and heat until sauce is velvety smooth and sugar has all been dissolved. When adding sugar, DON’T Panic! The mixture becomes VERY thick and sugar isn’t dissolving. Try to get it all added, if possible. Then add the milk. I use a whisk to stir. By the time it is done, no sugar crystals should remain."
